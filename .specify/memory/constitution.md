# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution

## Core Principles

<!--
  Run /speckit.constitution to replace these placeholders with your project's
  non-negotiable principles. Each principle should follow the
  Statement + Constraints + Rationale format shown below.

  Example principles to consider:
  - Simplicity (YAGNI, minimal abstractions)
  - Testing philosophy (TDD, coverage, communication)
  - Idempotency / safety guarantees
  - Interface preferences (CLI, API, UI)
  - Output formats and determinism
-->

### I. [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]

**Statement**: [PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION — declarative, using MUST/SHOULD language]

**Constraints**:
- [What this principle forbids or limits]
- [Boundaries that implementations must respect]

**Rationale**: [Why this principle exists — the cost of violating it]

### II. [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]

**Statement**: [PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]

**Constraints**:
- [What this principle forbids or limits]
- [Boundaries that implementations must respect]

**Rationale**: [Why this principle exists]

### III. [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]

**Statement**: [PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]

**Constraints**:
- [What this principle forbids or limits]
- [Boundaries that implementations must respect]

**Rationale**: [Why this principle exists]

## Scope

### In Scope

- [PRIMARY_CAPABILITY_1]
- [PRIMARY_CAPABILITY_2]

### Out of Scope

- [EXCLUDED_CAPABILITY_1 — and why]
- [EXCLUDED_CAPABILITY_2 — and why]

## Testing Philosophy

<!--
  Default: TDD required. Tests are written before implementation.
  Adjust to match your project's needs during /speckit.constitution.
-->

- **TDD required**: Write tests before implementation code.
- Tests MUST cover all acceptance criteria from the spec.
- Tests SHOULD be independent and deterministic.
- Prefer integration tests at system boundaries; unit tests for complex logic.
- Test failures block merges — no exceptions.

## Quality Gates

| Phase | Gate | Required |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Pre-Commit** | Tests pass, linter clean, no secrets in diff | Yes |
| **Pre-Merge** | All CI checks green, PR reviewed or self-reviewed against spec | Yes |
| **Release** | All acceptance criteria verified, no open `bug` issues for milestone | Yes |

## Development Workflow

- All work happens on feature branches, merged to `main` via pull request.
- Follow the spec-kit workflow: specify → plan → tasks → implement.
- Commit after each logical unit of work with a descriptive message.
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Track work with GitHub Issues: label `feature` for new work, `bug` for defects.

## Key Decisions

<!--
  Record significant architectural or design decisions here.
  Each decision should have a revisit trigger — a condition under which
  the decision should be reconsidered.
-->

| # | Decision | Date | Revisit Trigger |
|---|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | [DECISION_DESCRIPTION] | [DATE] | [CONDITION_THAT_WOULD_CHANGE_THIS] |

## Governance

This constitution is the highest-priority reference for all implementation decisions. If a spec
or plan conflicts with a principle here, the constitution wins. Amendments require updating this
file, incrementing the version, and noting the change in the sync impact report comment above.

### Elevated Constraints

Some principles are **non-negotiable**. Relaxing an elevated constraint requires:

1. Explicit justification documented in the relevant spec or plan.
2. Approval from the project owner.
3. A note in the Key Decisions table with a revisit trigger.

<!--
  Mark principles as elevated by adding ⚑ after the principle name, e.g.:
  ### I. Simplicity ⚑

**Version**: 0.0.0 | **Ratified**: [RATIFICATION_DATE] | **Last Amended**: [LAST_AMENDED_DATE]
